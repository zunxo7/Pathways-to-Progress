## Project Description

Pathways to Progress is an 8-week community service project initiated in collaboration with the Pakistan Red Crescent Society (PRCS). The project addresses road safety as a major public-health challenge in Pakistan, where thousands of preventable accidents result in deaths, injuries, and long-term disabilities each year.

The project focuses on promoting road safety and first aid awareness, educating schoolchildren and community members, and strengthening emergency preparedness. Through hands-on engagement, fieldwork, and educational activities, the project aims to create real, visible, and lasting impact on local communities.

The project was conducted in the H-8 sector of Islamabad, working directly with schools, traffic police, and local communities. Activities included field observations, surveys, and direct engagement to understand specific safety challenges faced by residents, particularly around schools and high-traffic areas.

## Key Objectives

- Teach first aid basics to students and children
- Promote helmet use, seatbelt safety, and proper road-crossing habits
- Increase public awareness of emergency contact numbers
- Build and donate first-aid kits to schools
- Create zebra crossings to improve pedestrian safety
- Collaborate with Islamabad Traffic Police for real-world traffic management experience
- Strengthen civic sense, leadership, communication, and teamwork

## Alignment with SDGs
